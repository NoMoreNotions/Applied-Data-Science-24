# Applied-Data-Science-24
Course materials for PHYS247-Introduction to Applied Data Science (University of California, Riverside)

### Session 1:
In this session, we cover basics of python programming, beginning with installation of different distributions (Anaconda, VSCode, GoogleColab) which can be used to start coding in Python! We then go over basics of Python programming including simple mathematical calculations, operators in python, variables and data types, data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries), control flow statements (e.g., `if/else`, `for`, `while` statements), and finally functions.
